## Mechanics Question

**Question (Source: [name the source]):**  
*A 2 kg block slides down a frictionless incline angled at 30°. What is the acceleration of the block down the incline?*

**Correct Answer:**  
\( a = g \sin(\theta) = 9.8 \times \sin(30^\circ) = 4.9 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

## Electricity & Magnetism Question

**Question (Source: [name the source]):**  
*A point charge of +2 µC is placed 0.2 m away from a second point charge of -2 µC. What is the magnitude of the electric force between them?*

**Correct Answer:**  
Use Coulomb’s Law:  
\( F = \frac{k |q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = \frac{9 \times 10^9 \times (2 \times 10^{-6})^2}{0.2^2} = 0.9 \, \text{N} \)
